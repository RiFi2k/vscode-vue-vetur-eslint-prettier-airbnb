# vscode-vue-vetur-eslint-prettier-airbnb
* One config to rule them all - Working, fast saving, no double rules.
* Auto-formats and lints .vue, .js, .scss
* If anyone is interested I have configs that plug and play with all these which add auto-format and linting for PHP files as well.

NOTE: Now I put all my dot files into the package.json file to reduce clutter, so I'll include it both ways here.

## VSCode Extensions
* EditorConfig for VS Code - editorconfig.editorconfig
* ESLint - dbaeumer.vscode-eslint
* Prettier - Code formatter - esbenp.prettier-vscode
* stylelint - shinnn.stylelint
* Vetur - octref.vetur

Added my full list of extensions and also my user settings along with the workspace settings.
This is still working great and I use it everyday without fail.

If anyone is interested to load up my full setup they will probably be in for a suprise about how I have the editor set up.
**I promise if you tried the file explorer on the right side for a week or two you would never go back!!!**

I also use [VSCodium from this github repo](https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium) and my user settings have pretty much every random hidden tracker instance turned off that I could find.
